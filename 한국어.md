## 100 Days of 한국어
Each day, starting on Friday, Januaray 1st, 2021, I will spend 1 hour learning and improving upon 한국어. I really wanted to do this becasue I realized that I was too harsh and was causing myself to burnout, aslo casuing my lack of motivation to do things. 

Each week, I must: 
- learn 30-50 words
- have a vocab test a the end of the week
- have at least 1 day where I review past lessons
- do a practice TOPIK exam
- study for an hour a day (with the exception of 30 min day each week)
- write 5-10 sentences and daily reflection
- record videos of me speaking hangeul
